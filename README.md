# Login and Registration

It's a complete object-oriented programming login and registration system having security features such as SQL Injection, data sanitize and validate, protection against bots, password hashing, redirecting, informing if login and email is available.
After login there's user's pannel displaying basic information about his account and accurate time retrieving from server showing days, hours, minutes and seconds informing about the expiration of the premium subscription.
Apart from all that, I created a system that changes the login and password by requiring the user's email address.
After providing the email address, a new password and login are created, and it is updated in the database.
The user is then redirected and receives a message with the new password.
